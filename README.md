# Password Generator Starter Code


## Description

This browser-based password generator will allow you to generate a strong password for your convinience.

Following options are available with this generator:
- length of the password (8-128 characters)
- character types (case, numeric, special characters)

This project was also for my personal learning to consolidate my knowledge on basic JavaScript concepts, incorporating with HTML and CSS.


## Usage

<!-- Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ``` -->
