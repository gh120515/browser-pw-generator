# Password Generator Starter Code


## Description

This browser-based password generator will allow you to generate a strong password (at least 8 characters in length and at least two types of characters) for your convinience.

Following options are available with this generator:
- length of the password (8-128 characters)
- character types (case, numeric, special characters)

This project was also for my personal learning to consolidate my knowledge on basic JavaScript concepts, incorporating with HTML and CSS. It was especially useful in testing my skills on correctly defining and executing functions.


## Usage

If characters other than requested is entered in the prompt (or left empty), or if no characters are selected in the follow-up prompts, the generator will return an error.
